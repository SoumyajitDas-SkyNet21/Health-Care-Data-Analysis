# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Using Python (Pandas)

This project explores a synthetic healthcare dataset containing patient records to uncover insights using **Pandas**. The dataset contains 500+ patient entries with various attributes such as age, gender, department, diagnosis, treatment cost, and outcomes.

Oncology has the highest average treatment cost.
```
### 11. Correlation Between Age and Treatment Cost
```
health_data['Age'].corr(health_data['Treatment_Cost'])
📌 Insight:
Weak negative correlation (-0.041) – age doesn't significantly affect cost.
```

health_data.groupby('City')['Treatment_Cost'].mean().idxmax()
📌 Insight:
Kevinberg has the highest average treatment cost.
```
### 14. Avg. Length of Stay by Diagnosis
```
health_data.groupby('Diagnosis')['Length_of_Stay'].mean()
📌 Insight:

Longest: Arthritis, Fracture (18 days)

Shortest: Migraine (12 days)
```
#### 15. Do Older Patients (60+) Have Higher Readmission Rates?

```
readmission_rate_above_60=health_data[health_data['Age']>60]['Readmission_Within_30_Days'].value_counts(normalize=True)*100
print(f'Readmission Rate of patients >60 years Old : {readmission_rate_above_60.iloc[1]}')
readmission_rate_below_60=health_data[health_data['Age']<60]['Readmission_Within_30_Days'].value_counts(normalize=True)*100
print(f'Readmission Rate of patients <60 years old : {readmission_rate_below_60.iloc[1]}')
📌 Insight:

60 years: 13.9%

<60 years: 20.2%

Surprisingly, younger patients had higher readmission rates.
```
#### 16. Department-wise Mortality Rate Analysis

```
mortality_rate=health_data[health_data['Outcome']=='Deceased'].groupby('Department').size()/health_data.groupby('Department').size()*100

📌 Insight:

Highest mortality: Orthopedics (44.77%)

Lowest mortality: Gastroenterology (25.88%)
```
